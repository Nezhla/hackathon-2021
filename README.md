# Swiss Open Research Data Hackathon 2021
SWITCH and FORS organise an Open Research Data (ORD) Hackathon to strengthen collaboration and build a community around ORD.
Students, academics, developers and service providers from Switzerland and beyond are invited to share their ideas and pave the way for innovative projects and applications.

## Hackathon Process
1. Submission of Ideas (now closed):
The Community submitted a total of 13 ideas to hack on. 
Please feel free to have a look at them here prior to the Hackathon.

1. Idea Presentation:
Each idea will be presented during the Kick-Off Event on 18th January 2021.

1. Choose idea to hack on:
Once the ideas are presented, each participant should decide on the idea to hack on. This is organised through a poll on Slack during the Kick-Off Event.

1. Team Building:
The polling will result in self-organised teams for each idea. Here, each team should decide upon a team leader who should make sure that all necessary skills are present in a given team. 

1. Hacking:
The actual Hacking starts once the teams are formed and continues throughout each Day of the Hackathon.

1. Presentations:
Each team will then be asked to present their Hacking results to the Community on Day 3. 

1. Voting:
After each team presented, we will organise a little voting via the a polling feature on Slack.

1. Prizes:
Based on the voting, SWITCH and FORS will offer some prizes for the winning teams.

1. Communicate:
Please feel free to spread the word and share the results during or after the Hackathon.
